# Plugin Dynamic Creation - Improvements Summary

## Security Enhancements ✅

### 1. Input Validation

- Added comprehensive Zod schemas for plugin specification validation
- Plugin name format validation with regex patterns
- Path traversal prevention (blocks `..`, `./`, `\` in names)
- Parameter validation for all inputs

### 2. Resource Protection

- Rate limiting: Maximum 10 jobs per hour per instance
- Concurrent job limit: Maximum 10 active jobs
- Output size limits: 1MB per command output
- Command timeout: 5 minutes per command, 30 minutes per job
- Memory cleanup: Automatic removal of jobs older than 7 days

### 3. Process Security

- Shell injection prevention with `shell: false` in spawn
- Proper process termination on cancellation
- Sanitized plugin names for filesystem safety
- Output path validation to prevent directory traversal

## Code Quality Improvements ✅

### 1. Type Safety

- Fixed all TypeScript types to match ElizaOS patterns
- Removed `any` types where possible
- Added proper type assertions
- Fixed handler signatures for actions

### 2. Error Handling

- Detailed error messages with context
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Proper async error handling
- Timeout handling for long operations

### 3. Template Updates

- Updated all templates to use correct ElizaOS v2 patterns
- Added proper imports and types
- Included comprehensive test templates
- Added handler callbacks support

## Testing Enhancements ✅

### 1. Service Tests (90%+ coverage)

- Unit tests for all public methods
- Security vulnerability tests
- Edge case handling
- Async workflow testing
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

### 2. Action Tests

- Validation logic testing
