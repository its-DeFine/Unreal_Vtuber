# Multi-Platform VTuber Chat Interaction System PRD

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of a **Unified Multi-Platform Chat Interaction System** that enables our VTuber to engage naturally with audiences across Twitch, YouTube, Discord, and other platforms simultaneously. The system introduces human-like chat monitoring, intelligent message prioritization, and seamless coordination with the existing Autoliza autonomous agent system.

## Problem Statement

Currently, VTuber interactions are limited to single-platform engagement or require separate scripts for each platform. This creates:

- **Fragmented audience experience** across platforms
- **Missed engagement opportunities** due to manual monitoring
- **Lack of intelligent prioritization** for high-value interactions
- **No coordination** between chat responses and autonomous system behavior
- **Inefficient streamer workflow** requiring multiple tools

## Vision

Create a unified system that makes our VTuber appear as a natural, engaging personality who can:
- **Monitor multiple chat platforms simultaneously**
- **Intelligently prioritize and respond to messages** based on context and importance
- **Exhibit human-like interaction patterns** with realistic attention mechanisms
- **Coordinate seamlessly with Autoliza** for enhanced autonomous behavior
- **Scale engagement** across growing audience sizes

## Core Requirements

### 1. Unified Chat Aggregation System

#### Platform Support (Phase 1)
- **Twitch Chat**: Real-time IRC/WebSocket integration
- **YouTube Live Chat**: YouTube Live Chat API integration
- **Discord**: Existing plugin enhancement for chat channels
- **Future Platforms**: Extensible architecture for additional platforms

#### Message Ingestion
```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  platform: 'twitch' | 'youtube' | 'discord' | string;
  channel: string;
  author: {
    id: string;
    username: string;
    displayName: string;
    badges: string[];
    isSubscriber: boolean;
    isModerator: boolean;
    followAge?: number;
  };
  content: {
    text: string;
    emotes?: Emote[];
    mentions?: string[];
    links?: string[];
  };
  metadata: {
    timestamp: number;
    messageId: string;
    threadId?: string;
    replyTo?: string;
  };
  salience: SalienceScore;
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Message Salience System

#### Salience Scoring Algorithm
Messages receive multi-dimensional scoring (0.0-1.0 scale):

**Content Analysis (40%)**
- Mentions/direct questions to VTuber: +0.4
- Emotional content (excitement, sadness, etc.): +0.2
- Technical/research topics matching VTuber interests: +0.3
- Creative suggestions or collaboration ideas: +0.25

**Author Authority (25%)**
- Subscribers/members: +0.15
- Long-term followers: +0.1
- Moderators: +0.2
- First-time chatters: +0.05 (welcome boost)

**Contextual Relevance (20%)**
- Matches current stream topic: +0.2
- References recent VTuber statements: +0.15
- Builds on ongoing conversation: +0.1

**Temporal Factors (15%)**
- Message recency (decay function): 0.15 → 0.0 over 5 minutes
- Response urgency (questions): +0.1
- Chat velocity adjustment: Dynamic scaling

#### Salience Categories
```typescript
enum SalienceLevel {
  CRITICAL = 0.8,    // Immediate response required
  HIGH = 0.6,        // Priority response within 30s
  MEDIUM = 0.4,      // Standard response queue
  LOW = 0.2,         // Background consideration
  IGNORE = 0.0       // Spam/filtered content
}
```

### 3. Human-Like Attention Mechanisms

#### Realistic Chat Monitoring Patterns
Simulate natural streamer behavior through attention cycles:

**Attention States**
- **Focused Interaction** (40% of time): High response rate, detailed answers
- **Casual Monitoring** (35% of time): Selective responses, brief acknowledgments
- **Deep Focus** (20% of time): Minimal chat interaction, focused on activity
- **Break/Transition** (5% of time): Catch-up mode, batch responses

**Attention Triggers**
- High salience message spikes
- Extended periods without interaction
- Platform-specific events (raids, donations, etc.)
- Autonomous agent recommendations

#### Interrupt Mechanisms
```typescript
interface AttentionInterrupt {
  type: 'message_spike' | 'high_salience' | 'platform_event' | 'autonomous_trigger';
  priority: number;
  context: {
    platform: string;
    messageCount?: number;
    averageSalience?: number;
    eventType?: string;
  };
  suggested_action: 'immediate_response' | 'queue_priority' | 'attention_shift';
}
```

### 4. Autoliza Integration & Coordination

#### Bidirectional Communication
**Chat → Autoliza Pipeline**
- Real-time chat sentiment analysis
- Topic trend detection across platforms
- Audience engagement metrics
- Strategic interaction opportunities

**Autoliza → Chat Pipeline**
- Autonomous conversation starters
- Strategic topic transitions
- Personality adjustment recommendations
- SCB space updates based on chat mood

#### Context Sharing
```typescript
interface ChatContextUpdate {
  platforms: {
    [platform: string]: {
      activeUsers: number;
      averageSalience: number;
      topTopics: string[];
      sentiment: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
      lastInteraction: number;
    };
  };
  globalContext: {
    totalMessages: number;
    responseRate: number;
    engagementTrend: 'increasing' | 'stable' | 'decreasing';
    recommendedAction: string;
  };
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. Chat Aggregator Service
```typescript
class ChatAggregatorService extends Service {
  private platforms: Map<string, PlatformAdapter>;
  private messageQueue: PriorityQueue<ChatMessage>;
  private salienceEngine: SalienceEngine;
  
  async aggregateMessages(): Promise<ChatMessage[]>;
  async prioritizeMessages(): Promise<ChatMessage[]>;
  async sendToAutoliza(context: ChatContextUpdate): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 2. Platform Adapters
```typescript
interface PlatformAdapter {
  connect(): Promise<void>;
  disconnect(): Promise<void>;
  sendMessage(message: string, channel: string): Promise<void>;
  onMessage(callback: (message: ChatMessage) => void): void;
  getChannelInfo(): Promise<ChannelInfo>;
}

// Implementations
class TwitchAdapter implements PlatformAdapter { /* ... */ }
class YouTubeAdapter implements PlatformAdapter { /* ... */ }
class DiscordAdapter implements PlatformAdapter { /* ... */ }
```

#### 3. Response Generation Pipeline
```typescript
interface ResponsePipeline {
  generateResponse(
    message: ChatMessage,
    context: ChatContextUpdate,
    autonomousGuidance?: AutonomousContext
  ): Promise<VTuberResponse>;
  
  formatForPlatform(
    response: VTuberResponse,
    platform: string
  ): Promise<PlatformMessage>;
}
```

### Database Schema

#### Chat Messages Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    platform VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    channel VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    author_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    author_username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    salience_score FLOAT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    response_id UUID REFERENCES chat_responses(id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_chat_messages_salience ON chat_messages(salience_score DESC, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_chat_messages_platform ON chat_messages(platform, created_at DESC);
```

#### Chat Responses Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_responses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    original_message_id UUID REFERENCES chat_messages(id),
    response_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    response_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    platform VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    autonomous_context JSONB,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP,
