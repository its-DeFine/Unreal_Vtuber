# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Autonomous Agent Statistics, Evolution & Persistence System

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: December 12, 2024  
**Author**: System Architecture Team  
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for transitioning the AutoGen autonomous agent system from simulation mode to full operational mode with comprehensive statistics tracking, persistent storage, and real-time evolution capabilities. The system will track all KPIs, store conversations, monitor tool usage, and enable actual code self-improvement while maintaining safety controls.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State
- System operates in simulation mode only
- Statistics are tracked in memory but lost on restart
- Tool usage is not properly recorded or reported
- Conversations are not persisted
- Evolution engine suggests improvements but cannot apply them
- No long-term learning from historical patterns
- Developers lack visibility into system performance over time

### Impact
- Cannot measure actual improvement over time
- System cannot learn from past experiences
- Developers must manually review logs for insights
- No data-driven decision making possible
- Self-improvement capabilities remain theoretical

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Enable Real Evolution**: Allow Darwin-GÃ¶del engine to make actual code improvements
2. **Persist All Statistics**: Store all KPIs and metrics in PostgreSQL
3. **Track Tool Usage**: Record every tool execution with context and results
4. **Store Conversations**: Persist all agent conversations for analysis
5. **Long-term Memory**: Use Cognee for semantic storage of important patterns
6. **Developer Dashboard**: Provide comprehensive reporting and analytics

### Success Metrics
- 100% of statistics persisted to database
- All tool executions tracked with performance metrics
- Evolution improvements measurable through KPIs
- Developer can query historical data spanning weeks/months
- System demonstrates measurable performance improvements
