    async def measure_operation(self, operation_name, func):
        start_time = time.time()
        start_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
        
        result = await func()
        
        end_time = time.time()
        end_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
        
        return {
            "duration": end_time - start_time,
            "memory_delta": end_memory - start_memory,

## Conclusion

The CORE AutoGen Cognitive Agent has a solid foundation with sophisticated multi-agent orchestration and intelligent tool selection. The main areas for improvement center around completing the mocked implementations (especially the evolution engine), fixing external integrations, and adding real machine learning capabilities. With these enhancements, the system could become a truly autonomous, self-improving AI agent platform.

The modular architecture makes it straightforward to implement these improvements incrementally without disrupting the working components. The priority should be on completing the evolution engine with real LLM integration and fixing the Cognee authentication to enable proper long-term memory and learning.
