  # Placeholder for a script that installs dependencies in all workspaces
  # This could be a custom script or using a tool like `npm install -ws` if applicable and effective.
  # For now, we'll assume `turbo` handles dependencies correctly or they are installed in specific steps.
  # You might need a script like this:
  # // scripts/install-workspaces.js
  # const { execSync } = require('child_process');
  # const workspaces = require('../package.json').workspaces;
  # workspaces.forEach(workspace => {
  #   console.log(`Installing dependencies in ${workspace}...`);
  #   try {
  #     execSync('npm install --legacy-peer-deps', { cwd: workspace, stdio: 'inherit' });
  #   } catch (error) {
  #     console.error(`Failed to install dependencies in ${workspace}:`, error);
  #     // process.exit(1); // Optionally exit if any workspace fails
  #   }
  # });
  # console.log('All workspace dependencies installed.');
  # Then in package.json scripts: "install:workspaces": "node ./scripts/install-workspaces.js"
