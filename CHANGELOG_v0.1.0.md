## NEW: Autonomous Agent System "Autoliza"

### Core Intelligence Features:
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: 30-second strategic cycles for continuous content optimization
- **Continuous Learning**: Builds knowledge base from every interaction
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation coherence across sessions
- **System-1 Reflexive Cognition**: Fast, heuristic-driven responses for immediate interaction
- **System-2 Deliberative Cognition**: Slower, reasoning-focused cycles triggered when System-1 writes to the SCB

### Autonomous Agent Toolkit:

#### VTuber Interaction Tools
- **`sendToVTuber`** - Strategic message delivery with autonomous context
- **`updateSCB`** - Real-time emotional state management
- **`doResearch`** - Live web research for current topics
- **`updateContext`** - Dynamic knowledge base updates

#### SCB (System Communication Bridge) Integration
- **Multi-Agent Bridge**: Coordinates messages between the Autonomous Agent, the LLM Speech Agent, and swarm-based SCB workers, ensuring consistent shared state.

## Database System Migration

### PostgreSQL Migration (Upgraded from PGLite)
- **Persistence**: All interactions saved permanently
- **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent operations
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance for critical data
- **Vector Support**: pgvector extension for advanced queries

---

## Enhanced VTuber Capabilities

### Neural Synchronization
- **NeuroSync Bridge**: Extracts facial blend shapes from audio and streams them in real-time for precise lip-sync and facial expressions within Unreal Engine.

### Advanced Conversation System
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent context across sessions
- **Knowledge Integration**: Fact incorporation from interactions
- **Learning from Preferences**: Adaptive responses based on prompts

---

## Infrastructure Improvements

### Docker Containerization
- **Easy Deployment**: Multi-container orchestration
- **Service Isolation**: Independent component management
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated service health checks
- **Development Ready**: Streamlined development workflow

### Network Architecture
- **Service Communication**: Optimized inter-service communication
- **Security**: Isolated network segments
- **Performance**: Optimized data flow

---

### Technical Stack
- **AI**: ElizaOS framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Graphics**: Unreal Engine
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Networking**: Custom service mesh
- **Processing**: Real-time neural synchronization
- **BYOC Architecture**: Bring Your Own Compute gateway that allows VTuber job implementation in the live network. When enabled in .env, users must pay through the BYOC gateway to interact with the VTuber.

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Build the complete VTuber system
docker compose -f docker-compose.bridge.yml -f docker-compose.byoc.yml build --progress=plain > build_logs.txt 2>&1

# Start the system
docker compose -f docker-compose.bridge.yml -f docker-compose.byoc.yml up

# To hear the audio output, add a media source to OBS with localfile unchecked and the following input:
# rtmp://localhost:1935/live/mystream
```
