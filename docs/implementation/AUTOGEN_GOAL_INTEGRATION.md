# ðŸ¤– AutoGen Goal Integration Guide

## How to Integrate Goal Management with Your Running AutoGen Agent

Based on our comprehensive **+666 edited lines** architecture, here's how to connect the goal-setting and metrics system to your actual AutoGen autonomous agent:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Answering Your Core Questions**

### 1. **How We Define Goals**
```python
# âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Natural Language â†’ SMART Goals
await define_autonomous_goal(
    "Improve agent decision speed and reduce errors", 
    priority=9
)

# Result: Complete SMART goal with:
# - Specific: "Reduce decision time to <2s while maintaining >95% success rate"
# - Measurable: 3 metrics (decision_time, success_rate, error_count)
# - Achievable: 4-step plan with concrete actions
# - Relevant: "Core performance improvement for user experience"
# - Time-bound: 7-day deadline with milestones
```

### 2. **How We Produce Correct Metrics**
```python
# âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Real-time Performance Collection
metrics_snapshot = await collect_real_time_metrics({
    "iteration": agent.iteration_count,
    "decision_time": agent.last_decision_time,  # From actual agent
    "success_rate": agent.success_rate,         # From actual agent  
    "error_count": agent.error_count,           # From actual agent
    "tool_used": agent.last_tool_used,          # From actual agent
    "memory_usage": psutil.virtual_memory().percent
})

# Automatic correlation with active goals:
# - Performance score calculation (0-100)
# - Goal progress updates based on metrics
# - Trend analysis and improvement opportunities
```

### 3. **How We Pass to Cognee Memory Effectively**
```python
# âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Structured Memory Storage
# Goal definitions stored as rich, searchable text:
"""
Goal Definition - goal_20241220_143052_a1b2c3d4

ðŸŽ¯ Title: Improve Decision Speed & Accuracy
ðŸ“Š Performance Score: 78.5/100
ðŸŽ¯ Target Metrics:
- decision_time: 2.0 seconds (current: 2.8s)
- success_rate: 0.95 percentage (current: 92%)

âš¡ Evolution Triggers: performance_degradation, milestone_achievement
"""

# Performance snapshots with correlation:
"""
Performance Metrics Snapshot - Iteration #127
âš¡ Performance Score: 78.5/100
ðŸ“ˆ Trend: improving
ðŸŽ¯ Goal-Performance Correlation: Moderate progress with good system health
"""
```

### 4. **When & How We Query Memory**
```python
# âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Automatic Query Triggers

# Trigger 1: Performance Degradation
if current_performance_score < (baseline_score - 10):
    insights = await query_performance_patterns(
        "performance degradation recovery strategy decision_time optimization"
    )

# Trigger 2: Goal Milestones  
if goal_milestone_achieved:
    strategies = await query_goal_memory(
        f"successful {goal.category} optimization milestone achievement"
    )

# Trigger 3: Evolution Cycles (every 5 iterations)
if iteration % 5 == 0:
    patterns = await query_evolution_memory(
        f"iteration {iteration} performance improvement code optimization"
    )
```

## ðŸ”Œ **AutoGen Integration Points**

### Integration with AutoGen Agent Loop

```python
# In your AutoGen agent loop (autogen_agent/agent.py):

async def agent_decision_cycle(self):
    """Enhanced agent loop with goal/metrics integration"""
    
    # 1. Collect performance data from current cycle
    performance_data = {
        "iteration": self.iteration_count,
        "decision_time": time.time() - self.cycle_start_time,
        "success_rate": self.calculate_success_rate(),
        "error_count": len(self.current_errors),
        "tool_used": self.last_tool_name,
        "memory_usage": self.get_memory_usage()
    }
    
    # 2. Integrate with metrics system
    metrics_service = await get_metrics_integration_service()
    snapshot = await metrics_service.collect_real_time_metrics(performance_data)
    
    # 3. Check for goal-driven evolution triggers
    if snapshot.overall_performance_score < 70:
        # Query Cognee for improvement strategies
        insights = await metrics_service.query_performance_patterns(
            "performance improvement optimization strategy"
        )
        
        # Trigger evolution if patterns suggest improvements
        if insights["correlations_found"] > 0:
            await self.evolution_service.trigger_evolution_manually(
                f"Performance degradation detected: {insights['insights']}"
            )
    
    # 4. Store metrics in Cognee every 10 minutes
    if self.iteration_count % 20 == 0:  # Assuming 30s cycles
        await metrics_service.store_metrics_in_memory(snapshot)
    
    # 5. Update goal progress based on performance
    goal_service = await get_goal_management_service()
    await goal_service.update_goal_progress_from_metrics(snapshot)
    
    # Continue with regular agent decision making...
```

### MCP Tools for Development Control

```python
# Available MCP tools for Cursor/development control:

# Define new goals during development
await define_autonomous_goal(
    "Reduce memory usage while maintaining performance",
    priority=8
)

# Check current goals and progress  
goals = await get_active_goals(status_filter="in_progress")

# Get next priority goal to work on
next_goal = await get_next_priority_goal()

# Generate comprehensive reports
report = await generate_goal_performance_report(timeframe_hours=24)

# Query memory for insights
insights = await query_goal_memory("optimization success patterns")
```

---

## ðŸš€ **Production Deployment Steps**

### Step 1: Update AutoGen Container
```bash
# Add goal management service to AutoGen container
cd app/CORE/autogen-agent
docker-compose build --no-cache autogen-cognitive-agent

# Start enhanced system
docker-compose -f config/docker-compose.cognitive.yml up -d
```

### Step 2: Initialize Goal System
```python
# Initialize services on agent startup
async def initialize_enhanced_agent():
    # Start goal management
    goal_service = await get_goal_management_service()
    await goal_service.initialize()
    
    # Start metrics integration
    metrics_service = await get_metrics_integration_service()  
    await metrics_service.initialize()
    
    # Verify Cognee connection
    cognee_service = await get_cognee_direct_service()
    await cognee_service.test_connection()
```

### Step 3: Define Initial Goals
```python
# Define foundational autonomous goals
initial_goals = [
    "Maintain sub-2 second decision times with 95%+ success rate",
    "Reduce system errors to zero per day",
    "Optimize memory usage to stay under 100MB average",
    "Improve code quality through autonomous evolution"
]

for goal_text in initial_goals:
    await define_autonomous_goal(goal_text, priority=8)
```

### Step 4: Monitor and Iterate
```bash
# Check system status
docker logs autogen-cognitive-agent -f | grep GOAL
docker logs autogen-cognitive-agent -f | grep METRICS
docker logs autogen-cognitive-agent -f | grep COGNEE

# Generate reports via MCP tools in Cursor
# Query memory patterns for optimization guidance
```
