  - âœ… Specific objectives and requirements
  - âœ… Measurable metrics and success criteria
  - âœ… Achievable milestones and checkpoints
  - âœ… Relevant context and dependencies
  - âœ… Time-bound deadlines and schedules

### Real-Time Performance Correlation
- **Metrics Pipeline:**
  - Performance data collection â†’ Goal correlation â†’ Trend analysis â†’ Cognee storage
  - Performance score: time_score(30%) + success_score(40%) + error_score(20%) + memory_score(10%)
  - Automatic goal progress updates based on performance correlation

### Cognee Memory Integration
- **Data Flow:**
  - Goal definitions â†’ Structured Cognee storage
  - Performance snapshots â†’ Memory with correlation analysis
  - Query triggers â†’ Automatic pattern recognition
  - Evolution cycles â†’ Learning from goal achievement patterns

### MCP Tools for Development Control
```
Available Tools:
- define_autonomous_goal: Create SMART goals from natural language
- get_active_goals: Retrieve current goal status and details
- get_next_priority_goal: Get highest priority actionable goal
- update_goal_progress: Update goal progress with performance data
