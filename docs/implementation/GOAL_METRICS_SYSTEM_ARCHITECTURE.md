## 🎯 Goal Definition System

### 1. SMART Goal Creation Process

**Input**: Natural language goal description
```
"Improve agent decision speed and reduce errors"
```

**AI Enhancement Process**:
```python
# Step 1: Parse natural language with context
goal_analysis = await analyze_goal_with_ai(natural_language_goal)

# Step 2: Generate SMART criteria
smart_criteria = {
    "specific": "Reduce average decision time to under 2.0 seconds",
    "measurable": [
        {"metric": "decision_time", "target": 2.0, "unit": "seconds"},
        {"metric": "success_rate", "target": 0.95, "unit": "percentage"},
        {"metric": "error_count", "target": 0, "unit": "count"}
    ],
    "achievable": [
        "Analyze current performance baseline",
        "Identify bottlenecks in decision process",
        "Implement targeted optimizations",
        "Measure and validate improvements"
    ],
    "relevant": "Faster decisions improve user experience and system efficiency",
    "time_bound": "7 days from creation"
}
```

### 2. Goal Categories & Prioritization

**Goal Categories**:
- **Performance**: Speed, efficiency, resource usage
- **Capability**: New features, tools, abilities  
- **Learning**: Knowledge acquisition, pattern recognition
- **Interaction**: User engagement, communication quality
- **Technical**: Code quality, architecture improvements
- **Autonomous**: Self-improvement, evolution capabilities

**Priority Levels**: 1-10 (10 = highest priority)

## 📊 Metrics Production System

### 1. Real-Time Metrics Collection

**Data Sources**:
```python
# Agent Performance Data (every decision cycle)
performance_data = {
    "iteration": 127,
    "decision_time": 2.3,          # seconds
    "success_rate": 0.92,          # percentage
    "memory_usage": 87.5,          # MB
    "error_count": 1,              # count
    "tool_used": "autogen_llm",    # string
    "context_hash": "ctx_127"      # string
}

# Goal-Related Metrics (every 30 seconds)
goal_metrics = {
    "active_goals_count": 3,
    "goals_progress_avg": 52.1,    # percentage
    "high_priority_goals": 2,      # count priority >= 8
    "overdue_goals": 0             # count past deadline
}
```

### 2. Metrics Processing Pipeline

```python
# Step 1: Collect Raw Data
snapshot = await metrics_service.collect_real_time_metrics(performance_data)

# Step 2: Calculate Performance Score (0-100)
performance_score = calculate_performance_score(
    decision_time=2.3,
    success_rate=0.92,
    error_count=1,
    memory_usage=87.5
)
# Result: 78.5

# Step 3: Correlate with Goals
goal_correlation = analyze_goal_performance_correlation(snapshot)
# Result: "Moderate progress on performance goals with good system health"

# Step 4: Generate Improvement Opportunities
improvements = identify_improvement_opportunities(snapshot)
# Result: ["Reduce decision time by 0.3s", "Eliminate remaining errors"]
```

### 3. Metrics Snapshot Structure

```python
@dataclass
class MetricsSnapshot:
    timestamp: datetime
    iteration_count: int
    
    # Core Performance
    decision_time: float
    success_rate: float
    memory_usage: float
    error_count: int
    tool_used: str
    
    # Goal Integration
    active_goals_count: int
    goals_progress_avg: float
    high_priority_goals_count: int
    overdue_goals_count: int
    
    # Analysis
    overall_performance_score: float  # 0-100
    trend_direction: str              # "improving", "stable", "degrading"
    improvement_opportunities: List[str]
```

## 🎯 Practical Usage Examples

### Example 1: Goal Definition & Tracking

```python
# 1. Define a new goal
goal = await goal_service.define_goal(
    "Reduce average response time to under 1.5 seconds while maintaining accuracy", 
    priority=9
)

# 2. Track progress automatically through metrics
# (Performance data flows automatically from agent operations)

# 3. Query for guidance when progress stalls
insights = await goal_service.query_goal_memory(
    "response time optimization successful strategies"

    "success_rate": 0.89,  # Getting worse
    "error_count": 2
})

# 2. Detect performance degradation
if snapshot.overall_performance_score < 70:
    # 3. Query for similar past issues
    patterns = await metrics_service.query_performance_patterns(
        "performance degradation recovery decision time"
    )
    
    # 4. Trigger evolution if patterns suggest improvements
