# 🤖 Autogen Orchestrator Agent - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version**: 2.0
**Date**: June 10, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Team**: Autonomous Systems

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

The Autogen Orchestrator Agent replaces the prior TypeScript implementation with a lightweight Python project built on the `autogen` framework. This orchestrator will serve as the default autonomous engine while retaining the ability to launch legacy Eliza agents when needed.

## 🎯 Product Vision

**"Enable scalable autonomous behavior through the Autogen framework while maintaining compatibility with existing tools."**

### Core Goals
- **Autogen Orchestrator**: Primary decision engine and chat manager
- **MCP & Tool Access**: Integrate MCP services and existing plugins via APIs
- **Legacy Support**: Optionally spawn Eliza agent instances from the orchestrator
- **Container Revamp**: Docker image updated with Python `autogen` package

---

## 🛠️ Key Features
1. **Autogen Integration** – Python script `autogen_orchestrator.py` powers the new orchestration layer.
2. **Docker Updates** – Container installs the `autogen` Python package for runtime support.
3. **Compatibility Layer** – Orchestrator can invoke Eliza agents for legacy tasks while primarily relying on Autogen.

## 🚀 Success Metrics
- Successful initialization of Autogen orchestrator
- Ability to trigger Eliza agents from orchestrator commands
- Container builds without errors including Python dependencies
