## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Salience-Based Prioritization**
Instead of responding to all messages equally, we prioritize based on:
- **Content relevance** (mentions, questions, emotions)
- **Author authority** (subscribers, moderators, loyal viewers)
- **Contextual fit** (topic relevance, conversation building)
- **Temporal urgency** (recency, question urgency, chat velocity)

### 2. **Human-Like Attention Patterns**
Rather than mechanical responses, we simulate natural streamer behavior:
- **Attention states** that change over time
- **Realistic response rates** that vary by state
- **Interrupt mechanisms** for truly important messages
- **Natural timing** that feels authentic

### 3. **Unified Yet Platform-Aware**
Single system that respects platform differences:
- **Consistent personality** across all platforms
- **Platform-specific formatting** (emotes, length limits, features)
- **Appropriate response styles** for each platform's culture
- **Graceful handling** of platform-specific events
