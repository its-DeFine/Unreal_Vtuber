# üìù Autogen Orchestrator Agent - Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

**Version**: 2.0
**Date**: June 10, 2025
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the functional requirements for the new Python-based autonomous-starter project. The Autogen Orchestrator manages tools and may spawn legacy Eliza agents when needed.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Autogen Execution**
   - `autogen_orchestrator.py` shall initialize the Autogen framework using environment configuration from `.env`.
   - The orchestrator shall start a basic group chat session with one assistant and one user proxy.

2. **Tool Access**
   - The orchestrator must be able to call existing MCP services and other tools via defined APIs.
   - Eliza agent instances can be launched from the orchestrator for backward compatibility.

3. **Container Updates**
   - The Dockerfile shall install the `autogen` Python package.
   - The container entrypoint runs `autogen_orchestrator.py` directly.

## 3. Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements
- **Reliability**: Orchestrator launch failures must be logged.
- **Maintainability**: Code is Python-only with clear boundaries for external integrations.
- **Security**: Environment secrets loaded by Autogen must not be logged.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Autogen orchestrator executes without errors.
- Container builds successfully with Autogen installed.
- Documentation (PRD/FRD) reflects the new architecture.
