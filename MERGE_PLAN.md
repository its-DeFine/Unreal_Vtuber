# üîÑ Branch Merge Plan: codex/add-cogni-memory-support ‚Üê extended-autonomy

## Current Situation
- **Current Branch:** `codex/add-cogni-memory-support` (commit: 9525f3b)
- **Target Branch:** `extended-autonomy` (commit: d7f02f1)
- **Uncommitted Changes:** Several files have been modified

## Pre-Merge Checklist

### 1. Commit Current Changes
```bash
# Stage and commit current changes on cogni-memory-support branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat(cognee): Enhance CogneeService with improved error handling and authentication

- Added robust authentication system with token management
- Improved error handling for LLM connection issues
- Enhanced memory storage with graceful degradation
- Added comprehensive logging and health monitoring
- Updated CogneeTypes with proper TypeScript interfaces"
```

### 2. Backup Current State
```bash
# Create a backup branch in case we need to revert
git branch backup/cogni-memory-support-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

### 3. Analyze Differences
```bash
# Check what files differ between branches
git diff --name-only extended-autonomy

# Check commit history differences
git log --oneline --graph codex/add-cogni-memory-support..extended-autonomy
```

## Merge Strategy Options

### Option A: Merge extended-autonomy into cogni-memory-support (Recommended)
This preserves the Cognee memory work while bringing in extended autonomy features.

```bash
# Merge extended-autonomy into current branch
git merge extended-autonomy

# If conflicts occur, resolve them and commit
git add .
git commit -m "merge: Integrate extended-autonomy features with Cognee memory support"
```

### Option B: Rebase onto extended-autonomy (Alternative)
This would replay the Cognee commits on top of extended-autonomy.

```bash
# Rebase current branch onto extended-autonomy
git rebase extended-autonomy

# Force push if needed (use with caution)
git push --force-with-lease origin codex/add-cogni-memory-support
```

## Expected Merge Conflicts

Based on the project structure, potential conflicts may occur in:

1. **`autonomous-starter/src/index.ts`** - Plugin loading and configuration
2. **`config/docker-compose.bridge.yml`** - Service definitions
3. **`.env` configuration** - Environment variable differences
4. **Package dependencies** - If both branches added different packages

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

### 1. Plugin Integration Conflicts
If both branches modified plugin loading in `index.ts`:
- Keep both sets of plugins
- Ensure conditional loading works correctly
- Verify no duplicate plugin registrations

### 2. Docker Configuration Conflicts
If docker-compose files conflict:
- Merge service definitions
- Ensure port mappings don't conflict
- Keep both Cognee and any new services from extended-autonomy

### 3. Environment Variable Conflicts
If `.env` or environment configs conflict:
- Merge all environment variables
- Ensure no conflicting values
- Update documentation accordingly

## Post-Merge Verification

### 1. Build Test
```bash
# Test that the merged code builds correctly
docker-compose -f config/docker-compose.bridge.yml build --no-cache autonomous-agent
```

### 2. Service Health Check
```bash
# Start services and verify they're healthy
docker-compose -f config/docker-compose.bridge.yml up -d
docker-compose logs -f autonomous-agent
```

### 3. Feature Verification
- [ ] Cognee memory functionality works
- [ ] Extended autonomy features are intact
- [ ] All plugins load correctly
- [ ] Database connections are stable
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly

## Rollback Plan

If the merge causes issues:

```bash
# Reset to the backup branch
git reset --hard backup/cogni-memory-support-TIMESTAMP

# Or if you've already pushed, create a revert commit
git revert -m 1 HEAD
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Merge Successful If:**
- All services start without errors
- Cognee memory functions work (add, search, cognify)
- Extended autonomy features are preserved
- No duplicate functionality or conflicts
- Clean git history with proper commit messages

## Notes

- The Cognee integration adds significant memory capabilities
- Extended autonomy likely adds enhanced decision-making features
- Both branches are valuable and should be preserved in the merge
- Consider creating a PR for review before merging to main

## Next Steps After Merge

1. Update documentation to reflect combined functionality
2. Run comprehensive tests on the merged system
3. Consider merging back to main branch if stable
4. Update any deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines
