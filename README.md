# Livepeer VTuber External Capability (BYOC)

This repository hosts the official VTuber external capability integration for Livepeer, utilizing a Bring Your Own Compute (BYOC) model. It enables users to integrate advanced VTubing functionalities with the Livepeer network.

## üì¢ Early Release Note

Please be aware that this is an early release. We are actively working on simplifying the installation and setup process. We appreciate your understanding and feedback!

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   Git
*   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
*   Minimum 20GB of RAM
*   Python 3.10
*   Docker Desktop
*   Unreal Engine Metahuman with LiveLink enabled
*   A topped-up Livepeer Gateway account (you can top up any account at [gwid.io](https://gwid.io/))

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the VTuber external capability:

### 1. Clone Repositories

You'll need to clone two main repositories. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the NeuroSync-Core repository (BYOC branch)
git clone -b BYOC https://github.com/its-DeFine/NeuroSync-Core.git

# Clone the Eliza Livepeer Integration repository (scb-org branch)
git clone -b scb-org https://github.com/its-DeFine/eliza-livepeer-integration.git
```

This will download the necessary codebases into your local environment. We recommend cloning them into a common parent directory for organizational purposes, for example, a directory named `livepeer-vtuber-byoc/`.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the `env_files/` directory within this main project folder. Inside this directory, you will find template/example `.env` files.

*   You will need to create and populate two `.env` files based on the provided examples. These files contain critical configuration details, such as API keys and service endpoints.
    *   **(TODO: Specify the names of the example .env files and what the final .env files should be named, e.g., `neurosync.env.example` -> `neurosync.env` and `eliza.env.example` -> `eliza.env`)**
    *   Note: Eliza-specific variables in the `.env` files can be left blank if you are not using those features.
    *   For orchestrator-relevant variables, please refer to the information available at [https://github.com/ad-astra-video/livepeer-app-pipelines](https://github.com/ad-astra-video/livepeer-app-pipelines).
*   Carefully fill in the required values in your newly created `.env` files.

```bash
# Example:
# cd env_files
# cp neurosync.env.example neurosync.env
# cp eliza.env.example eliza.env
# nano neurosync.env  # Or use your preferred editor
# nano eliza.env      # Or use your preferred editor
```

### 3. Build the Web Application

The user interface for managing and interacting with the VTuber capabilities is provided as a web application.

*   Navigate to the `webapp/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/cloned/repositories/eliza-livepeer-integration/packages/app # Adjust path if necessary, or to the main webapp folder if structure is different
    # Or, if the webapp is at the root of this project:
    # cd webapp
    ```
    **(TODO: Confirm the correct path to the webapp that needs `npm i` and `npm run build`)**

*   Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

*   Build the application:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

### 4. Running the System

Once your repositories are cloned and environment variables are configured, follow these steps:

1.  **Launch the Docker Containers**:
    Open your terminal in the directory where you cloned the repositories (e.g., inside `livepeer-vtuber-byoc/` if you followed the recommendation, ensuring `docker-compose.bridge.yml` and `docker-compose.byoc.yml` are accessible or correctly pathed) and run the following command. This command will build the necessary Docker images and then start the services. The build process can take some time, and logs will be saved to `build_logs.txt`.
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.bridge.yml -f docker-compose.byoc.yml build --progress=plain > build_logs.txt 2>&1 && docker compose -f docker-compose.bridge.yml -f docker-compose.byoc.yml up
    ```

2.  **Access the User Interface**:
    Once the containers are up and running, you can access the web UI by navigating to `http://localhost:8088` in your web browser.

3.  **Submit Transactions**:
    Follow the instructions in the UI to submit the necessary transactions from your wallet to interact with the Livepeer network.

4.  **Send Prompts to Your Metahuman**:
    After the job is successfully initiated and running, you can send prompts to your Metahuman. For example, you can change the text value in the following `curl` POST request to send a new prompt:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello from curl"}' http://localhost:5001/process_text
    ```

Enjoy your VTubing experience!
