# Livepeer VTuber External Capability (BYOC)

This repository hosts the official VTuber external capability integration for Livepeer, utilizing a Bring Your Own Compute (BYOC) model. It enables users to integrate advanced VTubing functionalities with the Livepeer network.

## üì¢ Early Release Note

Please be aware that this is an early release. We are actively working on simplifying the installation and setup process. We appreciate your understanding and feedback!

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   Git
*   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the VTuber external capability:

### 1. Clone Repositories

You'll need to clone two main repositories. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the NeuroSync-Core repository (BYOC branch)
git clone -b BYOC https://github.com/its-DeFine/NeuroSync-Core.git

# Clone the Eliza Livepeer Integration repository (scb-org branch)
git clone -b scb-org https://github.com/its-DeFine/eliza-livepeer-integration.git
```

This will download the necessary codebases into your local environment. We recommend cloning them into a common parent directory for organizational purposes, for example, a directory named `livepeer-vtuber-byoc/`.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the `env_files/` directory within this main project folder. Inside this directory, you will find template/example `.env` files.

*   You will need to create and populate two `.env` files based on the provided examples. These files contain critical configuration details, such as API keys and service endpoints.
    *   **(TODO: Specify the names of the example .env files and what the final .env files should be named, e.g., `neurosync.env.example` -> `neurosync.env` and `eliza.env.example` -> `eliza.env`)**
*   Carefully fill in the required values in your newly created `.env` files.

```bash
# Example:
# cd env_files
# cp neurosync.env.example neurosync.env
# cp eliza.env.example eliza.env
# nano neurosync.env  # Or use your preferred editor
# nano eliza.env      # Or use your preferred editor
```

### 3. Build the Web Application

The user interface for managing and interacting with the VTuber capabilities is provided as a web application.

*   Navigate to the `webapp/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/cloned/repositories/eliza-livepeer-integration/packages/app # Adjust path if necessary, or to the main webapp folder if structure is different
    # Or, if the webapp is at the root of this project:
    # cd webapp
    ```
    **(TODO: Confirm the correct path to the webapp that needs `npm i` and `npm run build`)**

*   Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

*   Build the application:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

### 4. Running the System

**(TODO: Add instructions on how to run the different components - NeuroSync-Core, Eliza integration, webapp, etc. This might involve `docker-compose up` or specific python/node commands.)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Simplifying Installation

We are actively working on streamlining this setup process. Future updates will aim to provide a more straightforward installation experience, potentially through unified scripts or enhanced Docker configurations.
