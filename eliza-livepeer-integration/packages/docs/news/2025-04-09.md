### /report Command Performance Optimization

- Initial Issue:

  - Command was slow and occasionally timed out.
  - Triggered by [spynter]'s observation of delays.

- Root Causes Identified:

  - Excessive data retrieval without pagination or filtering.

  - Added index on timestamp column.
  - Replaced Prisma ORM with raw SQL.
  - Introduced Redis caching (5-minute TTL).
  - Added proper async/await usage.
  - Implemented try/catch error handling.

- Results:

  - 60% performance improvement confirmed by [spynter].
  - Stability and responsiveness improved.

- Action Items:
  - Add timestamp index.
  - Use raw SQL for /report queries.
  - Implement Redis caching.
  - Improve error handling.
  - Add pagination support.
